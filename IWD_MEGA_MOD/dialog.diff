 We all must seek our own paths through life. I have chosen the path of the warrior, walking in the bloody footsteps of the Lord of Battles. As a woman, it is difficult to do at times, especially since I am a foreigner to this land. The native barbarians do not believe that foreigners understand what "Tempos" really stands for, and they certainly don't believe that women can be his champions or representatives on Toril. Perhaps someday this will change.

 Crafted in 1021 DR for the warrior Makael the Lean, Turodahel has a bloody military history. Makael was a mercenary who sold his services to anyone with the right amount of coin. Shrewd and crafty by reputation, Makael applied his skills and the power of Turodahel carefully for over three decades. It wasn't until after Makael died of a magical disease that legends about the man started to spring up. It is believed by modern sages that Makael is likely to have killed over five hundred men with his sword over the years. It was widely known that Makael was neither especially strong nor tough. People assumed that it must have been the power of the sword that made his deeds possible. Makael's grave was robbed within a few years of his burial.

 Another classification of undead, skeletal undead are, perhaps, the most common form of undead foe. Necromancers and evil priests use skeletal minions as cheap shock troops when less powerful undead are not available. Some necromancers will use advanced magic to create skeletal undead that are tougher, faster, and more resilient than their common counterparts. Because of their composition, skeletal undead are usually very resistant to slashing attacks and almost immune to missile fire.

This affects a total of 9 spell levels, for example 3 3rd-level or 1 4th and 1 5th-level etc.. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard as well as area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard, it will be reflected back upon the caster. As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be reflected.

After that, the skeletal armies of N'Ashtar would overrun their demoralized enemies. When N'Ashtar finally fell, the Skull of Death was supposedly destroyed.

 By exposing Wylfdene before the council, we've succeeded in stopping the war between the barbarians and the Ten Towns. However, it seems our quest is far from over. Hjollder believes that the corrupt spirit that fled Wylfdene's body may still pose a threat to his people. We've agreed to journey by ship to an island on the Sea of Moving Ice. Once there, we are to hunt down the flown spirit and put an end to its evil once and for all.

+his spear planted in the ground against
+Aehirglass's charge. The dragon's wings 
+were as shreds, its wounds were great, 
+but the dragon knew the day was his.
+
+It turned upon the last of the warriors, 
+Erris, the fourth Watchknight. There were
+no other warriors to be seen, for Lord
+Maluradek had still not taken the field.
+Erris rushed in to strike but was snatched
+up in the dragon's grip, and the creature's
+head reared back to bite the Watchknight's
+head from his body.
+
+Yet Aehirglass had not counted on Erris's

+grip, the Watchknight cleaved through its 
+neck with his mighty axe, the blade diving
+into the gap in the scales of the dragon's throat
+left by numerous spear and sword wounds. 
+
+With a mighty cry to Helm, he made two blows

+from the other side as the talons crushed at him, 
+and there was a twin cracking like thunder, 
+as the knight's body snapped in the dragon's grip...

+like a felled tree, then collapsed to the ground, 
+raising a cloud of sand across the Storm-Barrows.

+A dragon's death matched with the deaths of four
+Watchknights. What can be said of such a valiant battle,

+The traveling adventurer could ask for no better a suit of armor in all the land. Specially commissioned by Bolhur "Thunderaxe" at GREAT expense, this suit was his most prized, even if not his most ornate. Eminently practical, Bolhur demanded armor that would offer superior protection while hampering him in the least. By "hampering" he did not just mean in movement or weight, though this suit is just over one-third the weight of normal plate mail: His ideal suit should also be able to withstand the rigors of his wanderings with little maintenance. This is not to say that Bolhur "Thunderaxe" neglected his armors (to say as such would get your ears boxed) but the regime of spit and polish required for a "gentleman's" suit was beyond his caring. Save the tassels and gilding of full plate for kings and heads of state; a working dwarf cares more for utility than looks.

+Handmaiden's Mace
+
+40942:
+This mace has been crafted finely by the drow and specially treated to survive the glare of the sun. It was made for surface raids by the subterranean race... and its black metal glistens with a dark poison that seems to be generated from within and causes incredible damage upon a successful impact.
+
+The mace seems almost alive and warm to the touch, and slithers away from those whom it does not like... namely drow or those who are similar enough to not make a difference. In the hands of anyone else, the mace becomes mere dead weight.

+Darksteel Shield +4
+
+40944:
+Fashioned from dwarven darksteel, this heavily enchanted shield provides more protection than most suits of armor. Legend holds that it was meant to be presented as a gift to the dwarvish hero Glimred Heavyhand, but he disappeared on his ill-fated quest into the bowels of the Marching Mountains before the work was completed. With Glimred gone, the shield was sold to the highest bidder—though the dwarven smiths refused to divulge the mysterious buyer's identity.

+Golem
+
+41444:
+Golem
+"Golem" is a broad term that covers many types of magical constructs. Most are humanoid, though they can be of inhuman size, and most require magical means to destroy them.

+Lycanthrope

+Basilisk
+
+41448:
+Minotaur
+
+41449:
+Myconid
+
+41450:
+The basilisk is called "king" because it is reputed to have on its head a mitre or crown shaped crest. Stories of the basilisk show that it is not completely distinguished from the cockatrice. The basilisk is alleged to be hatched by a cockerel from the egg of a serpent or toad (the reverse of the cockatrice, which was hatched from a cockerel's "egg" incubated by a serpent or toad). Basilisks are also know for their deadly ability of a petrifying gaze, so great care should be taken if one is ever encountered.
+
+41451:
+Minotaurs were evil giant muscular humanoids with fur-covered bodies and bull-like heads. It was once believed that all minotaurs were male; actually cursed humans that had been altered by the gods or a demon lord to become a minotaur. That legend proved false as female minotaurs became more prevalent over the years. They loved to dwell within maze-like caverns or ruins, where their innate sense of direction prevented them from getting lost. They lured travelers into their maze-like homes, where the minotaurs had the advantage over their unfortunate prey.
+
+41452:
+Myconids live in the underdark in various colonies called circles, a circle consists of twenty or more myconids who live together work together and meld together. Myconids are brightly colored fungi creatures who come in all shapes and sizes.Their physical features vary greatly from circle to circle and even within the circles themselves. The inside of a myconid has a soft texture similar to that of a mushroom however their bones are near the surface, and are hard and have a seemingly metallic feel.

+The origins of this ring are unclear, and while its enchantments share similarities with historical examples of Rings of Wizardry, there is something strange in how it feels, either in the weight of the metal or in the aura it projects, and it does not function the same. It was likely found on some distant plane and, as such, its maker will remain a mystery to you.

One night, in the arms of a lady of the night, he whispered his secret. His martial arts training was supplemented by the thin gauntlets he wore, which allowed him to hit more accurately and with harder punches than bare fists would normally allow. The woman stole the gloves and took the next boat out. Floating Bear soon left, returning to his homeland.

+
+41912:
+Gift of the Lost Soul
+
+41913:
+This ring has been empowered by the soul of Carnoer, a monk who seeked the death of Lyfes, for killing his family. For years Carnoer chased after Lyfes, but Lyfes knew, and he toyed with him all those years, knowing Carnoer would never get to him.
+
+It was not all in vain though, Caernor was a very skilled monk, and on his travels his disciplined increased, and his power grew. Being completely fueled by the determination of one day getting to Lyfes, Carnoer continued to increase in power and skill, waiting for the day he would finally catch up to his foe.
+
+Unfortunately though, Lyfes was no push over, especially for the fact that Lyfes was "contaminated" with divine blood, spilt from the heavens on to him when he was a babe, and because of that, Lyfes' power grew expodentially. Also being a monk he was incredibly qucik, and was infused with the power of sorcery as well. His god like heritage was proving to be very benificial to his predicament. The problem being, Lyfes' divine power was getting to him, and Lyfes believed that the only way to save the world, would be to destroy anyone or anything that was more powerful than a peasant.
+
+So with that, Lyfes began his crusade of slaughtering powerful beings and being quite successful at it. The more he slaughtered, the stronger he became. Although ironically, he wasn't a phsycopath, he never went out of his way to hurt or kill the weak, although if they were injured or killed by accident, he took no notice. Many people believed Lyfes to be evil, but Lyfes never saw it that way, and he refused to believe so, for his thought processing was above others he thought, and he only had one goal in mind: Cleanse the world of powerful beings, so the common folk may be at piece from them.
+
+Through Lyfes' escapades, he angered a wyrm dragon so much to the point, that the wyrm went out of it's way to hunt Lyfes himself. It finally found Lyfes in a small village; The village where Carnoer lived. Lyfes wasn't going to apologize for his dealings, and it enraged the wyrm, causing them to go to battle. Many people perished in the battle includeing the wyrm, it would have been quite a sight to see, that a human of divine blood taking down a dragon all by himself, which is completely unheard of.
+
+Not everybody in the village perished that day though, there was one other survivor, which was Carnoer, who was only 5 at the time, who watched his parents perish in the battle between the two powers. Lyfes noticed Carnoer afterwards, and smiled at him then disappeared into the horizon. Carnoer was left all by himself, with no one or nothing, and somehow he managed to travel to the nearby city without getting molested by anyone for the days travel.
+
+He found himself at Silver City. A city built on top of an enormous lake, which was rich with silver deposits at it's depths. Carnoer was quickly accepted into a monastery when he was picked up by someone he refered to as his "Uncle". For the years that followed Carnoer trained at the monastery, becoming more and more skilled at martial arts, and then one day Lyfes came to Silver City, looking for the strongest beings there; To continue his quest of "cleansing" the world. Well Uncle wasn't going to have any of that, and he went to go stop Lyfes, and it looked like Uncle was actually giving Lyfes a hard time at first, but then Lyfes smiled and finished Uncle off in a heart beat, all the while Carnoer watching, another one close to him has fallen, Lyfes noticed Carnoer when he finished his uncle off smiled at him, and then disappeared. 
+
+Carnoer was 18 now, and twice now he saw the same man take the ones close to him down, and the rage and furry boiling inside of him was taking over, and his inner ki was burning for retribution. Carnoer had one thing on his mind; Stop Lyfes once and for all.
+
+So Carnoer set out to find Lyfes and take him down once and for all. On his journeys all he could hear is how Lyfes was killing beings of great power, all by himself, without a whim or a care, and the rage for the innocents was burning inside Carnoer, he could feel it in his dreams, it would haunt him, but he welcomed it, it fueled him, and even Carnoer's Ki was even fueling off of his rage, making his skin and bones tougher, making him stronger and faster. With Carnoer's Ki increasing he used his power to help as many people as possible regardless of power and race, especially the ones that Lyfes had affected.
+
+Then finally, years later, came the time for confrontation. Lyfes was pleased to see Carnoer come for him, Lyfes heard of the power that Carnoer was gaining, and it filled Lyfes with glee to know that he would take Carnoer down and continue the world cleansing.
+
+The battle was fierce, even to the point where Lyfes was showing frustration in the skill and ability of Carnoer, but Carnoer had a weakness; His pure rage. It was undisciplined, it wasn't focused enough, and Lyfes waited for the right time, risking his own life for the perfect shot. The moment finally came and Lyfes dilevered a crippling blow to Carnoer and Carnoer wasn't able to recover from it. Lyfes stood over Carnoer, smiled and then finished him off.
+
+Carnoer's spirit was never able to rest after falling in battle, so it was placed into this ring, hoping to one day destroy Lyfes and rid the world of his existance. The ring offers many protections to aid the wearer in battle, to hopefully make it so another one doesn't have to fall to those of greater power.
