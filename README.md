# Sarevok57's Mega IWD mod

This repository aims to rewrite Sarevok57's Mega Icewind Dale Mod into community standard WeiDU format.

The original version of this mod was written for IWDEE 1.4 in a plain copy-to-override format, unprepared for longterm management, translation possibilities and component options, while introducing a lot of features in the game, which might not suit everyone.

With Sarevok57's blessing, the goal is to convert this mod from this old version to modern IWDEE formats via introducing WeiDU coding, opening up possibilies for components and similar convenience options.

This conversion is ongoing by Graion Dilach, via comparing all files against their vanilla 1.4 versions, noting the differences and then weidufying them.
